== Common API Overview

Common API and its machanism specific bindings (e.g. Common API D-Bus) provide a set of libraries and tools to work with 
RPC communication in a way independent of wich mechanism is used. It consist currently consists of four subprojects:
----
CommonAPI - This is the base C++ library, which provides the application interface for users and can
            load runtime bindings such as dbus. (This is the current package.) 
CommonAPI-Tools - The eclipse based tools for CommonAPI. This is essentially the code generator for 
                  Franca -> Common API C++ code. 
CommonAPI-D-Bus - This is the D-Bus binding C++ library, which provides the necesary code to communicate 
                  over D-Bus. This is invisible to the application code, and simply needs to be linked against. 
CommonAPI-D-Bus-Tools - The eclipse based tools for CommonAPI D-Bus. This is the code generator for 
                        Franca -> Common API D-Bus C++ code.
----
== Build Instructions

Use autotools to build this package:
----
# ./autoreconf -i
# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install (or alternative install process, eg. checkinstall on debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu)
----
If the environment variable GTEST_CONFIG is set to the path of the gtest-config script in a Gtest tree test will also be built.  

== Working on the code & contribution

.First get the code from the git:
        git clone 

.Get an overview of all branches:
        git branch

.Switch to the branch you want to work on (master is the feature branch) and verify that it has switched (* changed)
        git checkout <your branch>
        git branch

.Best practice is to create a local branch based on the current branch:
        git branch working_branch

Start working, best practice is to commit smaller, compilable pieces during the development process that makes it easier to handle later on.

.If you want to commit you changes, send them to the author, you can create a patch like this:
        git format-patch working_branch <your branch>

This creates a set of patches that are published via the mailing list.The patches will be discussed and then merged & uploaded on the git by the maintainer.

Patches can be accepted either under GENIVI Cla or MPL 2.0 (see section License). Please be sure that the signed-off-by is set correctly. For more, check out http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html
